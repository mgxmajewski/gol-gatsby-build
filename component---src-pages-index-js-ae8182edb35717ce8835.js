A most basic simplified explanation would be that it is a set of rules describing how cells of a 2-dimensional grid change their state in time (more precisely discrete iterations). There are many types of cellular automaton and Conway's Game of Life is one of them but the whole concept was originally discovered in the 1940s by Stanisław Ulam and John von Neumann (Manhattan Project). Another famous cellular automaton is Rule 30.
